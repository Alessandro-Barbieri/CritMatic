## [v0.3.8.1-release] - 11/25/2023

### Fixed:

- **Good news! We've fixed a bug that affected how the crit log displayed information for spells that can both heal and damage. Previously, if a spell had both of these capabilities, the crit log wasn't displaying correctly.**

- **This issue did not affect spells that were exclusively for healing or damage. With this latest update, you can expect accurate and consistent display for all spells, regardless of whether they heal, damage, or do both.**

- **Thank you for your continued support and feedback, which helps us improve CritMatic. Enjoy your enhanced gaming experience!**
