## [v0.3.6.2.4-release] - 11/12/2023

### Fixed:

- **Addressed the issue where critical hits (crits) were not consistently displayed correctly in the CritMatic addon, a bug fix has been implemented. This should resolve the intermittent inaccuracies in the alerts and chat crit display.**

- **a bug has been fixed that was preventing new critical hits (crits) from being announced in battlegrounds, raids, and parties. This update ensures that crit announcements are correctly broadcasted in these group environments.**
