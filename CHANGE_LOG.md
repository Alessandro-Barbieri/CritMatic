## [v0.3.5.9.6-release] - 11/4/2023

### Updated:

- **We've overhauled the internal code structure for the Options Tables to pave the way for an exciting new feature
  dubbed "CritLog." Picture a widget similar to the Deathlog addon, which you can toggle on or off. The CritLog will
  track and display your critical strikes, regular hits, critical heals, and standard heals. Accessing this feature will
  be a breeze with the new slash command `/cmlog`. Stay tuned as we begin the development phase!**
- **We've updated the font color for the "CritMatic Loaded" notification for better visibility and style.**
